# About Me

## My interests
1. I love cars, planes, trains, and anything with an engine. I drive a 2012 Camaro SS.
2. Anime is another passion of mine, I love watching shows with great writing and good plot development. My favorite anime is Haikyuu!!
3. Math is my favorite subject, it makes sense to me. The way that everything has to follow a logic based algorithm in math just clicks for me
## Websites I Recommend
1. [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com) - I find this a great source of anime shows and movies!
2. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - A great site to learn pretty much anything, or entertain yourself with endless content about everything you can think of!
3. [FaceBook Marktetplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) - I love scrolling through nearby listings to see what gems I can stumble upon!
